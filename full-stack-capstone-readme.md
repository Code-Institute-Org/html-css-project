## AI Implementation and Orchestration

### Use Cases and Reflections:
(Highlight how prompts, such as reverse, question-and-answer or multi-step, were used to support learners with SEND or ALN where relevant.)

  - **Code Creation:** 
    - Reflection: Strategic use of AI allowed for rapid prototyping, with minor adjustments for alignment with project goals. 
    - Examples: Reverse prompts for alternative code solutions and question-answer prompts for resolving specific challenges.
  - **Debugging:** 
    - Reflection: Key interventions included resolving logic errors and enhancing maintainability, with a focus on simplifying complex logic to make it accessible.
  - **Performance and UX Optimization:** 
    - Reflection: Minimal manual adjustments were needed to apply AI-driven improvements, which enhanced application speed and user experience for all users.
  - **Automated Unit Testing:**
    - Reflection: Adjustments were made to improve test coverage and ensure alignment with functionality. Prompts were used to generate inclusive test cases that considered edge cases for accessibility.

- **Overall Impact:**
  - AI tools streamlined repetitive tasks, enabling focus on high-level development.
  - Efficiency gains included faster debugging, comprehensive testing, and improved code quality.
  - Challenges included contextual adjustments to AI-generated outputs, which were resolved effectively, enhancing inclusivity.
