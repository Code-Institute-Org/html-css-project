   <h1>Project Implementation Guide</h1>
    <p>The phased approach to project implementation is designed to ensure a structured, manageable, and systematic process for developing a website project. By dividing the project into distinct phases, learners can focus on specific tasks and objectives, making it easier to track progress, identify issues, and achieve high-quality results. This methodical approach allows for iterative development, regular testing, and refinement, ensuring that the final product meets all specified requirements and standards.</p>

    <h2>Phase 1: Ideation & Initial Setup (4 hours)</h2>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> In this phase, the primary goal is to lay a solid foundation for the project by defining its purpose, audience, and design. This involves brainstorming ideas, creating user stories, and setting up the project environment.</p>
    <p><strong>Ideation and User Story Definition (1.5 hours):</strong> This task involves brainstorming and refining project ideas, defining user stories that capture the project's essential features and functionality, and documenting these stories in the README. This process helps clarify the project's goals and ensures that the development is user-centered.</p>
    <p><strong>Initial Planning and Wireframing (1.5 hours):</strong> Learners will outline the website's structure and design through wireframes. This includes sketching key pages, choosing color schemes and fonts, and planning content placement. Documenting these decisions helps in creating a clear design blueprint and facilitates a user-centric approach.</p>
    <p><strong>Environment Setup and Version Control (1 hour):</strong> Setting up the development environment includes creating a GitHub repository, organizing project files, and linking necessary resources. Proper documentation of this setup ensures that the project is well-organized and version-controlled from the start.</p>
    <p><strong>Pass Grade - Expected Outcomes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>A clear understanding of the project's purpose and target audience.</li>
