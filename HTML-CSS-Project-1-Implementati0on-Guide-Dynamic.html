        <h2>Rationale for Phased Approach</h2>
        <p>The phased approach to project implementation is designed to ensure a structured, manageable, and systematic process for developing a website project. By dividing the project into distinct phases, you can focus on specific tasks and objectives, making it easier to track progress, identify issues, and achieve high-quality results. This methodical approach allows for iterative development, regular testing, and refinement, ensuring that the final product meets all specified requirements and standards.</p>
        
        <h2>Allocated Project Time: 14 hours</h2>
        
        <h2>Health and Well-Being Guidance</h2>
        <p>Given the allocated project time of 14 hours, it's essential to balance productivity with health and well-being. Here’s how you can maintain a healthy approach during this intensive project period:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Manage Your Time Wisely</strong>: Break down the 14 hours into focused work sessions with short breaks in between. Use techniques like the Pomodoro Technique to maximize productivity.</li>
            <li><strong>Take Regular, Short Breaks</strong>: Incorporate micro-breaks every 25-30 minutes to rest your eyes and stretch.</li>
            <li><strong>Maintain a Functional Workspace</strong>: Optimize ergonomics and ensure adequate lighting to reduce physical strain.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Hydrated and Nourished</strong>: Keep water nearby and choose healthy snacks to maintain energy levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Balance Work and Rest</strong>: Set clear boundaries between focused work and relaxation periods.</li>
            <li><strong>Get Enough Rest Before the Project</strong>: Ensure you are well-rested before starting the project to improve concentration.</li>
            <li><strong>Reflect and Adjust</strong>: Regularly monitor your progress and adjust your pace if necessary.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Positive and Focused</strong>: Maintain a positive mindset and avoid perfectionism.</li>
        </ul>

                        <p>The goal of this phase is to lay a solid foundation for the project by defining its purpose, audience, and design. This involves brainstorming ideas, creating user stories, and setting up the project environment. Learners will utilize AI tools such as GitHub Copilot for ideation and content generation, and DALL-E for image creation. Minimal documentation will support these tasks, ensuring that AI’s role in the project is recorded.</p>
