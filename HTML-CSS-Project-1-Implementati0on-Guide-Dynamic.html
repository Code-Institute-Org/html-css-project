 <h2>Project Guide</h2>

<button class="accordion">Phase 1: Ideation & Initial Setup (4 hours)</button>
<div class="panel">
    <h3>What’s the goal of this phase?</h3>
    <p>In this phase, the primary goal is to lay a solid foundation for the project by defining its purpose, audience, and design. This involves brainstorming ideas, creating user stories, and setting up the project environment.</p>

    <h3>What are My Tasks?</h3>
    <h4>Ideation and User Story Definition (1.5 hours):</h4>
    <p>This task involves brainstorming and refining project ideas, defining user stories that capture the project's essential features and functionality, and documenting these stories in the README. This process helps clarify the project's goals and ensures that the development is user-centered.</p>

    <h4>Initial Planning and Wireframing (1.5 hours):</h4>
    <p>You will outline the website's structure and design through wireframes. This includes sketching key pages, choosing color schemes and fonts, and planning content placement. Documenting these decisions helps in creating a clear design blueprint and facilitates a user-centric approach.</p>

    <h4>Environment Setup and Version Control (1 hour):</h4>
    <p>Setting up the development environment includes creating a GitHub repository, organizing project files, and linking necessary resources. Proper documentation of this setup ensures that the project is well-organized and version-controlled from the start.</p>

    <h3>What Should Be in Place By The End Of This Phase?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A clear understanding of the project's purpose user stories and target audience.</li>
        <li>Wireframes, images, fonts, colors, and design decisions chosen and documented.</li>
        <li>A fully set up development environment (IDE project) with version control (GitHub repository) in place.</li>
    </ul>
