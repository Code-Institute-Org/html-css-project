    <h1>Project Implementation Guide</h1>
    <p>The phased approach to project implementation is designed to ensure a structured, manageable, and systematic process for developing a website project. By dividing the project into distinct phases, learners can focus on specific tasks and objectives, making it easier to track progress, identify issues, and achieve high-quality results. This methodical approach allows for iterative development, regular testing, and refinement, ensuring that the final product meets all specified requirements and standards.</p>

    <h2>Phase 1: Ideation & Initial Setup (4 hours)</h2>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> In this phase, the primary goal is to lay a solid foundation for the project by defining its purpose, audience, and design. This involves brainstorming ideas, creating user stories, and setting up the project environment.</p>
